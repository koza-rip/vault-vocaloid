This site features the BANG DREAM! GIRLS BAND PARTY! collection of the salty mountain goat [KOZA](https://koza.rip) and the anxious red panda [SVEN](https://svenxiety.xyz). We've been collecting BANDORI merchandise since approximately 2018, and acquire items through a mix of local, online, and import purchases. Our collection contains both brand new and secondhand items.
